# Introduction
A simple RISC-V processor running a Hello World program using *ADDI, LUI, SB, LBU, BEQ, BNE, JAL*, and *JALR* Instructions.
# Simulation
1. First run the following command to run Questa/ModelSim
```
python run.py -g
```
2. In the "Transcript" window, enter the following command to start the simulation
```
vunit_restart
```
